Hey guys,

One important thing, I wanted to say !!

The purpose of these tasks are to train you for the future tasks that'll be allocated to you, when the Real App development starts !

So it doesn't matter, how many tasks you have completed, but if you have just copy and pasted them, then it doesn't matter, because when the real Project tasks will be allocated that time you'll face the problems, while coding !

And in turn slow down the whole team !!

So don't just copy and paste the code, if your facing any kinda off trouble, just ask me personally !!

But the end result is you should know how to code in flutter.

Final conclusions of your coding abilities for Flutter will be drawn by the Team leaders that is Myself, so at the end, number of tasks won't matter, you need to show us that you'll can code and be committed, dedicated and consistent, during the actual app cycle development !!
We need to see, that you all can code from your own, because the projects tasks won't be this simple, and at that time you'll have you write the whole code on your own ! 

So if you really wanna grow, then work hard for yourself !
